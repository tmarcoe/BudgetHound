<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<h5>The idea of a budget is simple, <b>Live within your means.</b> If you make $1,000,000 and your expenses are $1,000,001, you're still broke.
Sometimes the simple advice is more difficult that it sounds. When your income is <i>X</i> and your necessary expenses are <i>X + 1</i>, 
it can be difficult to manage. This site cannot do miracles, it can only give you the information to know how to proceed, but information 
is power and in this case, it's the power to get of your budget to be manageable again.</h5>

<h3><b>Basic Idea</b></h3>
<h5>Budget Hound works by categorizing all of your expenses. If you see something in your budget that looks big, you can focus in on a category 
create sub-categories to see why the main category is so big. 

For Example:
Let's say that after entering all my transactions, I notice that My 'Food And Groceries' category is unusually big. I can create categories
under 'Food And Groceries' like 'Snacks', 'Cold Drinks', 'Meats', etc... This will tell me where my 'Food and Groceries' budget is going.
I might look at that and determine that I am spending way too much on 'Cold Drinks' and find another alternative (water maybe?). 
By drilling down, categorizing and sub-categorizing, you can finally see where all the money is going. Budget Hound can even create a graph
so you can visualize where the money is going.</h5>

<h3><b>Getting Started</b></h3>
<h5>To start, simply fill out some basic information. We <b>DO NOT</b> share your information with anyone. This is only so we can help you better.
After filling out this information, login with your email and newly created password. After logging in, you will see a blank transaction register. 
Click the button that says 'New Entry' and begin entering any money that you spend. Be sure and categorize all of the 'withdrawals' but do not 
categorize any 'deposits'. This will help Budget Hound to <i>"sniff out"</i> where the money is going. To see a visual breakdown of where the
Money is going, press the button labeled 'Breakdown'. It's just that simple.</h5>

<h3><b>Categories</b></h3>
<h5>When you click on the The 'Categories' button, you enter the categories screen is where you can create your own categories and sub-categories. 
You can also see the total amount that is spent on each category. We've created 10 budget categories for you. You are welcome to create your own, 
if you wish. However, no 2 categories can have the same name. To enter a category, press the 'New Category' button, at the bottom of the table and 
type the category name. To enter a sub-category, open the category that you wish to make a parent, by pressing the 'Open' button, next to the category. 
Then click the 'New Category' button. You can delete any user defined categories but you cannot delete any of the predefined categories.</h5>
